# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to anwer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Wich skills are associated with higher salaries?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

-**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

-**PostgresSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

-**Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

-**Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs.
To identify the highest-paying role, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    c.name company_name
FROM job_postings_fact j

LEFT JOIN  company_dim AS c
    ON j.company_id = c.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breackdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from 184,000 to 650,000 indicationg significant salary potential in the field.
